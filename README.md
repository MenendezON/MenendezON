  ### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
### Menendez NELSON ###
From a bachelor's degree in applied computer science to a master's degree in information systems management and an MBA in corporate governance with a specialization in project management,
I have acquired broad experience in IT and software development.
I have always been fascinated by information technology concepts, and new technologies such as deep learning, machine learning, artificial intelligence, and data analysis are even more fascinating.
Actually, I'm following a cursus as a Software developer at Microverse.
